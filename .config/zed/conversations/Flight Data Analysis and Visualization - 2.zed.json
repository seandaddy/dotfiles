Please download the dataset Flights 2010-2011.csv and using Python complete the following task:\n\ndata structures are as follows:\nIndex(['Aircraft Registration', 'Airline', 'Cancelled?', 'Departure Time',\n       'Destination Airport Code', 'Destination City Name',\n       'Destination State', 'Diverted?', 'Flight Date', 'Origin Airport Code',\n       'Origin City Name', 'Origin State', 'Airtime', 'Arrival Delay',\n       'Arrival Delay (Min)', 'Carrier Delay', 'Departure Delay',\n       'Distance (Miles)', 'Elapsed Time', 'Number of Records'],\n      dtype='object')\n\nUsing 4 different chart types discuss your findings on the Flights dataset. One of those charts should be a Tree map(3 points)\n\nEach chart should follow discussions to tell me what inferences I can make from those charts. (4 points).\n\nProvide the python script in the appendix section (2 points)\nSure, let's start by loading the dataset and then creating the required charts. We'll use libraries like pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly for visualization.\n\nFirst, let's load the dataset and inspect it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the dataset\ndf = pd.read_csv('Flights 2010-2011.csv')\n\n# Display the first few rows of the dataset\nprint(df.head())\n```\n\nNow, let's create the four different charts and discuss the findings.\n\n### 1. Bar Chart: Number of Flights per Airline\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Count the number of flights per airline\nflights_per_airline = df['Airline'].value_counts()\n\n# Plot the bar chart\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nflights_per_airline.plot(kind='bar')\nplt.title('Number of Flights per Airline')\nplt.xlabel('Airline')\nplt.ylabel('Number of Flights')\nplt.show()\n```\n\n**Discussion:**\nFrom the bar chart, we can infer which airlines had the most flights during the period of 2010-2011. This can help us understand the market share of different airlines in terms of flight frequency.\n\n### 2. Pie Chart: Proportion of Cancelled Flights\n\n```python\n# Count the number of cancelled and non-cancelled flights\ncancelled_flights = df['Cancelled?'].value_counts()\n\n# Plot the pie chart\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))\ncancelled_flights.plot(kind='pie', autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=90)\nplt.title('Proportion of Cancelled Flights')\nplt.ylabel('')\nplt.show()\n```\n\n**Discussion:**\nThe pie chart shows the proportion of flights that were cancelled versus those that were not. This can give us an idea of the reliability of flights during this period.\n\n### 3. Box Plot: Distribution of Arrival Delays by Airline\n\n```python\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# Plot the box plot\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\nsns.boxplot(x='Airline', y='Arrival Delay (Min)', data=df)\nplt.title('Distribution of Arrival Delays by Airline')\nplt.xlabel('Airline')\nplt.ylabel('Arrival Delay (Min)')\nplt.xticks(rotation=90)\nplt.show()\n```\n\n**Discussion:**\nThe box plot shows the distribution of arrival delays for each airline. This can help us identify which airlines tend to have more delays and the variability of those delays.\n\n### 4. Tree Map: Number of Flights by Origin State\n\n```python\nimport plotly.express as px\n\n# Count the number of flights per origin state\nflights_per_state = df['Origin State'].value_counts().reset_index()\nflights_per_state.columns = ['State', 'Number of Flights']\n\n# Plot the tree map\nfig = px.treemap(flights_per_state, path=['State'], values='Number of Flights',\n                 title='Number of Flights by Origin State')\nfig.show()\n```\n\n**Discussion:**\nThe tree map provides a visual representation of the number of flights originating from each state. Larger areas represent states with more flights. This can help us understand the distribution of flight origins across different states.\n\n### Appendix: Python Script\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport plotly.express as px\n\n# Load the dataset\ndf = pd.read_csv('Flights 2010-2011.csv')\n\n# Bar Chart: Number of Flights per Airline\nflights_per_airline = df['Airline'].value_counts()\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nflights_per_airline.plot(kind='bar')\nplt.title('Number of Flights per Airline')\nplt.xlabel('Airline')\nplt.ylabel('Number of Flights')\nplt.show()\n\n# Pie Chart: Proportion of Cancelled Flights\ncancelled_flights = df['Cancelled?'].value_counts()\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))\ncancelled_flights.plot(kind='pie', autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=90)\nplt.title('Proportion of Cancelled Flights')\nplt.ylabel('')\nplt.show()\n\n# Box Plot: Distribution of Arrival Delays by Airline\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\nsns.boxplot(x='Airline', y='Arrival Delay (Min)', data=df)\nplt.title('Distribution of Arrival Delays by Airline')\nplt.xlabel('Airline')\nplt.ylabel('Arrival Delay (Min)')\nplt.xticks(rotation=90)\nplt.show()\n\n# Tree Map: Number of Flights by Origin State\nflights_per_state = df['Origin State'].value_counts().reset_index()\nflights_per_state.columns = ['State', 'Number of Flights']\nfig = px.treemap(flights_per_state, path=['State'], values='Number of Flights',\n                 title='Number of Flights by Origin State')\nfig.show()\n```\n\nThis script covers the loading of the dataset, creation of the four different charts, and the discussions of the findings from each chart.\nwhat do I need to do with Mime type rendering requires nbformat version 4.2 or higher?\nThe error message \"Mime type rendering requires nbformat version 4.2 or higher\" typically occurs when you're trying to render certain types of visualizations or outputs in a Jupyter notebook, and the notebook format version is outdated.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you need to ensure that you have the correct version of the `nbformat` package installed.

Given that you are using Python 3.13, which is a very recent version, there might be some compatibility issues with certain libraries. Let's try a few steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue.\n\n### Step 1: Ensure All Required Packages Are Installed and Up-to-Date\n\nFirst, let's make sure all the necessary packages are installed and up-to-date. Run the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:\n\n```sh\npip install --upgrade nbformat\npip install --upgrade plotly\npip install --upgrade pandas\npip install --upgrade matplotlib\npip install --upgrade seaborn\n```\n\n### Step 2: Verify Jupyter Notebook Installation\n\nEnsure that Jupyter Notebook is installed and up-to-date:\n\n```sh\npip install --upgrade notebook\n```\n\n### Step 3: Restart Jupyter Notebook\n\nIf you had Jupyter Notebook running while performing the upgrades, restart it to apply the changes.\n\n### Step 4: Use the Correct Renderer for Plotly\n\nSometimes, specifying the renderer explicitly can help resolve rendering issues. You can specify the renderer for Plotly visualizations. For example, you can use the `notebook` renderer for Jupyter Notebook.\n\nHere is the updated script with the renderer specified:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport plotly.io as pio\n\n# Set the renderer for Plotly\npio.renderers.default = 'notebook'\n\n# Load the dataset\ndf = pd.read_csv('Flights 2010-2011.csv')\n\n# Bar Chart: Number of Flights per Airline\nflights_per_airline = df['Airline'].value_counts()\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nflights_per_airline.plot(kind='bar')\nplt.title('Number of Flights per Airline')\nplt.xlabel('Airline')\nplt.ylabel('Number of Flights')\nplt.show()\n\n# Pie Chart: Proportion of Cancelled Flights\ncancelled_flights = df['Cancelled?'].value_counts()\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))\ncancelled_flights.plot(kind='pie', autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=90)\nplt.title('Proportion of Cancelled Flights')\nplt.ylabel('')\nplt.show()\n\n# Box Plot: Distribution of Arrival Delays by Airline\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\nsns.boxplot(x='Airline', y='Arrival Delay (Min)', data=df)\nplt.title('Distribution of Arrival Delays by Airline')\nplt.xlabel('Airline')\nplt.ylabel('Arrival Delay (Min)')\nplt.xticks(rotation=90)\nplt.show()\n\n# Tree Map: Number of Flights by Origin State\nflights_per_state = df['Origin State'].value_counts().reset_index()\nflights_per_state.columns = ['State', 'Number of Flights']\nfig = px.treemap(flights_per_state, path=['State'], values='Number of Flights',\n                 title='Number of Flights by Origin State')\nfig.show()\n```\n\n### Step 5: Run the Script in Jupyter Notebook\n\nOpen Jupyter Notebook and run the script. If you still encounter issues, try using a different renderer, such as `iframe` or `svg`:\n\n```python\npio.renderers.default = 'iframe'  # or 'svg'\n```\n\n### Additional Troubleshooting\n\nIf the issue persists, consider running the script in a different environment, such as JupyterLab or a standalone Python script, to see if the problem is specific to Jupyter Notebook.\n\nIf you continue to experience issues, please provide more details about the error message and the environment you are using, and I can offer further assistance.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":336}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":28},"start":935,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":337}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":29},"start":5285,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":338}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":113},"start":5372,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":339}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":114},"start":7006,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":340}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":161},"start":8414,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":341}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":162},"start":11284,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":342}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":297},"start":11314,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":343}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":298},"start":14596,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":344}}}],"summary":"Flight Data Analysis and Visualization","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
