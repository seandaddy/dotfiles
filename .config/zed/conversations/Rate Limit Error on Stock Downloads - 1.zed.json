Try after a while.')\nIt looks like you encountered a rate limit error while trying to download data for NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation) and CME (CME Group Inc.) from Yahoo Finance. This error occurs when too many requests are made to the Yahoo Finance API in a short period of time.\n\nHere are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Wait and Retry**: Simply wait for a while before trying to download the data again. The rate limit is usually temporary and should reset after some time.\n\n2. **Reduce Frequency of Requests**: If you are making multiple requests in a short period, try to space them out to avoid hitting the rate limit.\n\n3. **Use a Different Data Source**: Consider using alternative data sources such as Alpha Vantage, IEX Cloud, or Quandl, which may have different rate limits or offer more generous free tiers.\n\n4. **Use a Proxy or VPN**: Sometimes, using a different IP address can help bypass the rate limit. However, be cautious with this approach as it may violate the terms of service of the data provider.\n\n5. **Check for API Key**: Some data providers offer API keys that can help manage rate limits more effectively. Check if Yahoo Finance offers such an option or consider switching to a provider that does.\n\n6. **Implement Caching**: If you are repeatedly requesting the same data, consider implementing a caching mechanism to store and reuse previously fetched data instead of making new requests each time.\n\nIf you are using a specific library or tool to fetch the data, you might also want to check its documentation for any built-in mechanisms to handle rate limits or for recommendations on best practices.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":14}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":8},"start":342,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":15}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":9},"start":1969,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":16}}}],"summary":"Rate Limit Error on Stock Downloads","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}],"thought_process_output_sections":[]}
