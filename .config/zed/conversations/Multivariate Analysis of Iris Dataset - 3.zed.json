Using 4 different chart types (heatmaps, pairwise scatter plots, parellel coordinates plot, bubble chart ) discuss your findings from the multivariate analysis of the Iris dataset. (3 points)\n\nEach chart should follow discussions to tell me what inferences I can make from those charts. (4 points).\n\nProvide the python script in the appendix section (2 points)\nSure, let's perform a multivariate analysis on the Iris dataset using the specified chart types. The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples from each of three species of Iris flowers (Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica). Four features were measured from each sample: the lengths and the widths of the sepals and petals.\n\n### 1. Heatmap\nA heatmap is a graphical representation of data where individual values are represented as colors. It is useful for identifying correlations between variables.\n\n#### Inferences:\n- The heatmap shows that petal length and petal width have a high positive correlation (close to 1), indicating that as petal length increases, petal width also increases.\n- Sepal length and petal length also show a positive correlation, though not as strong as the petal length and petal width.\n- Sepal width has a weak negative correlation with petal length and petal width.\n\n### 2. Pairwise Scatter Plots\nPairwise scatter plots (also known as pair plots) show the relationship between each pair of features in the dataset.\n\n#### Inferences:\n- The scatter plots show clear clustering of the three species based on petal length and petal width. Iris setosa is well-separated from the other two species.\n- There is some overlap between Iris versicolor and Iris virginica, but they can still be distinguished based on petal dimensions.\n- Sepal dimensions are less effective in distinguishing between the species compared to petal dimensions.\n\n### 3. Parallel Coordinates Plot\nA parallel coordinates plot is a way to visualize high-dimensional data. Each feature is represented by a vertical axis, and each data point is represented by a line that intersects each axis at the corresponding feature value.\n\n#### Inferences:\n- The parallel coordinates plot shows that Iris setosa can be easily distinguished from the other species based on its lower petal length and petal width.\n- Iris versicolor and Iris virginica show some overlap, but Iris virginica generally has higher values for petal length and petal width.\n- Sepal dimensions are less effective in distinguishing between the species compared to petal dimensions.\n\n### 4. Bubble Chart\nA bubble chart is a scatter plot in which a third dimension of the data is shown through the size of markers.\n\n#### Inferences:\n- By plotting petal length against petal width and using sepal length as the size of the bubbles, we can see that Iris setosa forms a distinct cluster with smaller petal dimensions and smaller sepal lengths.\n- Iris versicolor and Iris virginica show some overlap, but Iris virginica generally has larger petal dimensions and larger sepal lengths.\n- The bubble chart reinforces the finding that petal dimensions are more effective in distinguishing between the species compared to sepal dimensions.\n\n### Appendix: Python Script\n\n```python\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom pandas.plotting import parallel_coordinates\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Load the Iris dataset\niris = sns.load_dataset('iris')\n\n# Heatmap\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))\nsns.heatmap(iris.corr(), annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')\nplt.title('Heatmap of Iris Dataset')\nplt.show()\n\n# Pairwise Scatter Plots\nsns.pairplot(iris, hue='species')\nplt.suptitle('Pairwise Scatter Plots of Iris Dataset', y=1.02)\nplt.show()\n\n# Parallel Coordinates Plot\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))\nparallel_coordinates(iris, 'species', color=['blue', 'orange', 'green'])\nplt.title('Parallel Coordinates Plot of Iris Dataset')\nplt.show()\n\n# Bubble Chart\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))\nsizes = iris['sepal_length'] * 100  # Scale sepal length for bubble size\nsns.scatterplot(data=iris, x='petal_length', y='petal_width', hue='species', size=sizes, sizes=(20, 200), alpha=0.5)\nplt.title('Bubble Chart of Iris Dataset')\nplt.xlabel('Petal Length')\nplt.ylabel('Petal Width')\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThis script will generate the four types of charts and provide visual insights into the relationships between the features and the species in the Iris dataset.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[3], line 4\n      1 # %%\n      2 # Heatmap\n      3 plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))\n----> 4 sns.heatmap(iris.corr(), annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')\n      5 plt.title('Heatmap of Iris Dataset')\n      6 plt.show()\nFile ~/.pyenv/versions/3.13.0/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pandas/core/frame.py:11049, in DataFrame.corr(self, method, min_perio\nds, numeric_only)\n  11047 cols = data.columns\n  11048 idx = cols.copy()\n> 11049 mat = data.to_numpy(dtype=float, na_value=np.nan, copy=False)\n  11051 if method == \"pearson\":\n  11052     correl = libalgos.nancorr(mat, minp=min_periods)\nFile ~/.pyenv/versions/3.13.0/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pandas/core/frame.py:1993, in DataFrame.to_numpy(self, dtype, copy, n\na_value)\n   1991 if dtype is not None:\n   1992     dtype = np.dtype(dtype)\n-> 1993 result = self._mgr.as_array(dtype=dtype, copy=copy, na_value=na_value)\n   1994 if result.dtype is not dtype:\n   1995     result = np.asarray(result, dtype=dtype)\nFile ~/.pyenv/versions/3.13.0/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pandas/core/internals/managers.py:1694, in BlockManager.as_array(self\n, dtype, copy, na_value)\n   1692         arr.flags.writeable = False\n   1693 else:\n-> 1694     arr = self._interleave(dtype=dtype, na_value=na_value)\n   1695     # The underlying data was copied within _interleave, so no need\n   1696     # to further copy if copy=True or setting na_value\n   1698 if na_value is lib.no_default:\nFile ~/.pyenv/versions/3.13.0/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pandas/core/internals/managers.py:1753, in BlockManager._interleave(s\nelf, dtype, na_value)\n   1751     else:\n   1752         arr = blk.get_values(dtype)\n-> 1753     result[rl.indexer] = arr\n   1754     itemmask[rl.indexer] = 1\n   1756 if not itemmask.all():\nValueError: could not convert string to float: 'setosa'\nThe error occurs because the `iris` DataFrame contains non-numeric data (the species column), which cannot be used in the correlation calculation.
